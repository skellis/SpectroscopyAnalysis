"# Python-Spectroscopy-and-Crystal-Analysis" 
The text files tccoordinates and hydrogencoordinates contain carbon and hydrogen coordinates of the unit cell of a tetracene crystal extracted from mercury. 

The python program is UnitCell.py which plots the crystal coordinates after various symmetry operations are applied. Init.py contains various functions for manipulating the symmetry of the coordinates.
